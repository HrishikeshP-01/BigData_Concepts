# Big data concepts: getting to know Big Data

#### What is Big Data?
Data that is large, complex & difficult to process using traditional methods

## Sources of Big Data
4 predominant sources are:
- Social media – likes, comments, media
  - Provides invaluable insight into customer behavior which is used for marketing
  - Provides a wealth of information for companies to analyze & learn
- Email – 
  - Mining data from an organization’s email account gives us insight into activity level of employees, health of business pipeline, customer behavior etc.
- Sensor data – 
  - IoT generate & record data
- Open data –
  - Provided by govt. agencies that provide open datasets

## Characteristics of Big Data
- *Volume* – huge vol. of data
- *Velocity* – speed in which data is processed
- *Variety* – different types of data can be in big data & it needs to be organized
- *Variability* – the meaning of data is constantly changing
- *Veracity* – making sure the data is accurate
- *Visualization* 
- *Value* – the data must have some value to user

#### Difference between variety & variability
In a coffee shop there are many types of coffee. This is variety. If you order the same blend every day & it tastes different each time, this is called variability.

## Big data analytics answers questions traditional BI answers & a lot more:
#### Traditional BI:
- What happened
- When? Who? Where?
#### Advanced big data analytics:
- Why did it happen?
- Will it happen again?
- What else does the data tell us?

#### BI deliverables:
- Reports
- Dashboards
- KPI metrics
- Scorecards
- Ad-hoc queries
#### Big data deliverables
- All deliverables of BI
- Predictive models
- Multivariate & text/image analytics

## Advantages of Big Data analytics
- Faster & better decision making
- New products & services can be offered according to customer requirements obtained by analyzing data
- Cost reduction in business operations
- Real-time monitoring & forecasting of transactions
- Identification of hidden points & patters within very large datasets
- Ability to accumulate & aggregate data from multiple sources

## Major challenges in Big Data
- *Data growth* – storing large datasets is extremely difficult to handle. Companies are using compression, tiering, duplication etc. to handle such data.
- *Unfamiliarity with big data methods* – confusing it with traditional data methods is some of the biggest mistakes made by companies
- *Data security issues* – companies now use access control, real-time security monitoring, data encryption, data segregation, endpoint security, etc.
- *Data integration* – data comes from a variety of sources & integrating them is crucial for analytics

# Big Data Concepts: Big Data Essentials

## Difference between Data Warehouse & Big Data technologies
#### Data warehouse:
- Can only store DBMS compatible data
- Handles only structured data
- Doesn’t utilize distributed file systems
- Requires SQL knowledge
- Query time has a direct correlation with data volume

#### Big data technologies:
- Can store any kind of data
- Handles structured, unstructured & semi-structured data
- Utilizes distributed file systems
- Requires knowledge of alternative tools like Hive or SparkSQL
- Query time has no correlation with data volume & large requests may be processed as fast & small requests

## Data warehousing in the age of Big Data
- Organizations try to make the most of their unstructured data using existing data warehouses.
- Many big data tools started as POCs & then were launched in production-like capacity.
- Data warehouse is still relevant to this day & age.

## Types of computing
- *Parallel computing* – all processors have access to shared memory
- *Distributed computing* – each processor has its own memory & information is exchanged by passing messages

## Distributed computing advantages
- Allows different users/computers to share information
- Allows an application on 1 machine to leverage processing power, memory or storage from another machine
- Might enhance performance of stand-alone applications
- Allows enhancement of performance or availability

## Hadoop components
- *MapReduce* – computational model & software framework for applications run on Hadoop
- *HDFS* (Hadoop Distributed File System)  
- Hadoop application storage system

MapReduce consumes data from HDFS
Multiple replicas of data blocks are distributed on compute nodes in a cluster

- Hive
- HBase
- Mahout
- Sqoop
- Flume
- Zookeeper

MapReduce can easily tackle large datasets by distributing processing across many nodes then combining or reducing the results obtained from those nodes.
#### MapReduce Use Cases:
- A social networking site could use MapReduce to determine potential friends, colleagues & other contacts
- A booking website could use MapReduce to examine search criteria  & historical behaviors
- An industrial facility could collect equipment data from sensors across an installation & use MapReduce to tailor maintenance needs

#### HDFS uses-
- HDFS provides a fault tolerant storage structure
- World’s most reliable storage system
- Enables high throughput access to application data

**Hadoop works in a master-slave manner.**
HDFS has 2 types of nodes that work in the same manner:
1. NameNodes
  - Regulates file access to clients
  - Maintain & manage slave nodes & assign tasks to them
  - Executes file system namespace operations – opening, closing, renaming files & directories
  - This metadata is available in-memory in master for faster data retrieval & copy of metadata is also stored in local disk for persistence. So, typically, NameNode memory should be high.
2. DataNodes
  - Manages data storage
  - There could be up to 1000 DataNodes in HDFS 
  - They are the actual worker nodes that perform block creation, deletion & replication upon instruction from NameNode.
  - Run on commodity hardware with average configuration

1. *Schema on Read* – unprocessed data can be loaded into HDF with a structure applied at processing time based on the requirements of the processing application. 
2. *Schema on Write* – used in RDBMS where schema need to be defined before the data can be loaded

## Migration of Hadoop to cloud
Data platforms for cloud-native use are better than legacy Hadoop environments

#### Hadoop cloud advantages
- Lower infrastructure costs
- Data processing & performance improvement
- Higher data processing throughput
- Centralization of security credentials

#### Hadoop cloud migration
- Hadoop wasn’t designed for cloud infrastructure
- While cloud based Hadoop services is better than legacy Hadoop systems, both of them **lag behind modern data platform counterparts**. While migrating from Hadoop to a modern solution can be difficult, **staying with Hadoop could lead to greater costs**.

#### Hadoop cloud migration benefits
- Long-term cost savings
- Easy access & resource availability
- Better collaboration
- Better scalability
